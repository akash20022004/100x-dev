# Scaling techniques for Websockets

### 1. **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**

- **What It Is**: Sticky sessions, also known as session affinity, ensure that once a user connects to a particular server instance, they are routed back to the same server for subsequent requests or communications.
- **Why It Helps**: WebSocket connections are long-lived, and rerouting a WebSocket client to another server would typically require reconnecting, which can disrupt the user experience. Sticky sessions ensure that each WebSocket connection stays on a specific server for the duration of the connection.
- **Implementation**: Many load balancers (such as NGINX, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer) support sticky sessions. This can be configured based on cookies or IP hash.

### 2. **Pub/Sub Model for Cross-Instance Communication**

- **Why It’s Needed**: In a distributed WebSocket setup, each server instance is isolated from others. If a user connected to one instance needs to communicate with users connected to other instances, a way to broadcast messages across instances is required.
- **How It Works**: Use a **Pub/Sub messaging broker** like **Redis**, **Apache Kafka**, or **RabbitMQ** to send messages across all instances. When a message needs to be broadcast, it’s published to the Pub/Sub broker, which then pushes the message to all subscribed WebSocket servers. Each WebSocket server then forwards the message to its connected clients.
- **Redis Pub/Sub**: Redis is a popular choice for this setup because of its low latency. Each server instance subscribes to relevant channels and can publish messages that are automatically broadcast to all subscribers.

### 3. **Scaling Strategies**

- **Load Balancing with Sticky Sessions**: Use a load balancer to route connections to different server instances with sticky sessions to keep WebSocket connections stable.
- **Auto-scaling WebSocket Servers**: With a well-configured Pub/Sub system, WebSocket servers can be dynamically added or removed based on demand. Auto-scaling can be managed with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, where each instance subscribes to the necessary Pub/Sub channels.

### 4. **Best Practices**

- **Connection Pooling for Redis**: If using Redis as a Pub/Sub broker, ensure Redis can handle the number of concurrent connections, especially if you have many WebSocket servers.
- **Consider Message Order and Idempotency**: Messages might arrive out of order or be duplicated. Implement logic to handle this if your application requires strict order or unique messages.
- **Health Checks and Failover**: Ensure that load balancers can detect unhealthy WebSocket servers and redirect new connections accordingly.

### Example Workflow

1. **User Connection**: A user connects via WebSocket to the load balancer, which routes them to one of the WebSocket servers.
2. **Sticky Session Assignment**: The load balancer keeps this user connected to the same WebSocket server using sticky sessions.
3. **Message Broadcast**:
   - When this user sends a message intended for other users, the WebSocket server publishes the message to the Pub/Sub broker (e.g., Redis).
   - All WebSocket servers subscribed to this channel receive the message and forward it to their connected clients.

This approach helps maintain WebSocket connection consistency across instances and enables scalable, real-time communication across a distributed WebSocket infrastructure.
