### How to Deploy Frontend on AWS

- New concepts we will learn:
  - **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** An object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data.
  - **CloudFront (CDN):** A content delivery network to deliver your content with low latency.

### Build Your Frontend App

- **Note:** This approach will not work for Next.js as it uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

1. **Navigate to your project directory.**
2. **Build your project using the following command:**

   ```nginx
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Serve the HTML/CSS/JS locally to test:**

   Install the `serve` package globally:

   ```nginx
   npm i -g serve
   ```

   Serve your project:

   ```nginx
   serve
   ```

   At this point, you have basic HTML/CSS/JS code that you can deploy on the internet. While you might be tempted to host this on an EC2 instance, using S3 and CloudFront is a more efficient approach.

### What are CDNs ?

- A CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.
  As the name suggests, itâ€™s an optimal way for you to deliver content (mp4 files, jpgs and even HTML/CSS/JS files) to your users.

- It is better than serving it from a VM/EC2 instances because of a few reasons -

1. **EC2 machine apprach**

2. **CDN approach**

- For fronted, mp4 files, images, `object store` + `CDNs` are a better approcach
- You canâ€™t use the same for backends, since every request returns a different response. Caching doesnâ€™t make any sense there.

### Creating a object store in S3

- In AWS, S3 is their object store offering.
  You can create a bucket in there. A bucket represents a logical place where you store all the files of a certain project.

![one](./five.webp)

### Upload your file bundle in S3 (file & folder inside dist folder)

![one](./six.webp)

### Try accessing the website

- You might be tempted to open your S3 bucket at this point, but donâ€™t
  Your S3 bucket should be blocked by default, and you should allow cloudfront (CDN) to access it.

### Connecting a cloudfront

1. Create a Cloudfront distribution

- Go to cloudfront and create a new distribution. A distribution here means youâ€™re creating a place from where content can be distributed.

2. Select your S3 bucket as the source

![one](./nine.webp)

`ðŸ’¡ Origin Access Control (OAC) is a feature in Cloudfront, which allows you to restrict direct access to the content stored in your origin, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or a web server, ensuring that users can only access the content through the CDN distribution and not by directly accessing the origin URL`

- By the end of this, you should have a working cloudfront URL.
