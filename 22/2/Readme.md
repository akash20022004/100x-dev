## Horizontal Scaling

- Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling out, involves increasing the number of instances or servers to handle more load or traffic. This approach is essential for building scalable and resilient systems that can adapt to varying workloads. In this section, we will elaborate on the key concepts and mechanisms involved in horizontal scaling, particularly in the context of AWS (Amazon Web Services)

- Horizontal scaling represents increasing the number of instances you have based on a metric to be able to support more load. This is typically achieved through the use of auto-scaling groups, which automatically adjust the number of instances based on predefined metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics.
