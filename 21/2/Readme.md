# What we learning

- Stateful vs Stateless Backends
- State management in a Backned app
- Singleton Pattern
- Pub Subs + Singleton pattern

# Stateless Servers

- Stateless servers
  Usually when you write HTTP servers, they dont hold any state
  This means, they donâ€™t have any in memory variables that they use
  They usually rely on the database for state

### Advantages

1. Users can connect to a random server, there is no need of stickiness
2. Can autoscale up and down easily and simply decide where to route traffic based on CPU usage.

# Stateful Servers

- A lot of times servers store in memory variables like real-time games (bgmi, chess) where we need the output in a fraction of seconds, where a backend call takes a lot of time to give output. To remove the latency stateful servers are used.

1. Creating an in memory cache - `https://github.com/code100x/cms/blob/e905c71eacf9d99f68db802b24b7b3a924ae27f1/src/db/Cache.ts#L3`
2. Storing the state of a Game in case of a realtime game - `https://github.com/code100x/chess/blob/main/apps/ws/src/Game.ts#L41-L47`
3. Storing a list of 10 most latest chats in memory for a chat application

### Stickiness

- It means 100 player playing bgmi should connect to the same server means it stick to that server only, that should help stateful for real-time updates
- Making sure that the user who is interested in a specific room, gets connected to a specific server.

- The state might being used by multiple files, not just one, so the following approach might not work
