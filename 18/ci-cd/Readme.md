# What is CI and CD?

## Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository, preferably several times a day. Each integration is automatically verified by the monorepo we‚Äôre dealing with today.

[Monorepo Link](https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/week-18-2-ci-cd)

This monorepo contains three applications:
- `bank-webhook`
- `merchant-app`
- `user-app`

We‚Äôll be deploying all three to the same EC2 instance.

## Building the Project and Running Automated Tests
This process allows teams to detect problems early, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)
As the name suggests, CD involves deploying your code continuously to various environments (dev/stage/prod).

### Continuous Deployment in GitHub
We‚Äôll be deploying a Next.js app to EC2 servers via Docker.

üí° **Note:** You don‚Äôt necessarily need Docker when deploying to a simple EC2 server. However, if you deploy to:
1. GCP App Runner
2. ECS
3. Kubernetes

Then it makes more sense to deploy a Dockerized application.

üí° **Tip:** The last step of deployment varies based on where you‚Äôre pushing your image.

## How to Create a CI/CD Pipeline?
For GitHub, you can add all your pipelines to `.github/workflows`.

Example: [GitHub Workflow Example](https://github.com/code100x/cms/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint.yml)

# Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline Setup

## Step 1 - Create the CD Pipeline

Make sure that whenever someone tries to create a **PR**, we build the project and make sure that it builds as expected.

## üöÄ Setting Up the CD Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork the Main Repository
Fork the repository from: [100xdevs-cohort-2/week-18-2-ci-cd](https://github.com/100xdevs-cohort-2/week-18-2-ci-cd)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a GitHub Actions Workflow File
Create a new file at **`.github/workflows/build.yml`** in the root directory of the repository.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Workflow Configuration
Add the following YAML code to `build.yml`:

```yaml
ame: Build on PR

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Run Build
        run: npm run build
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Push Changes to `master` Branch
Commit and push the `build.yml` file to the `master` branch.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch & Open a Pull Request
1. Create a new branch and make minimal changes.
2. Open a **Pull Request (PR)**.
3. The GitHub Actions workflow should automatically run.

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior
- If the build succeeds, the PR is **valid** and can be merged.
- If the build fails, the PR will show an **error**, preventing broken code from being merged.
