### **Why Do We Need to Use a Cloud Database to Deploy?**

1. **Accessing the App Remotely**:

   - When an app is run locally, it is only accessible within the local network because it does not have a **public IP address**.
   - Public IPs are unique and allow devices to be accessible over the internet. However, the number of public IPs is limited and expensive to own directly.

2. **Role of Cloud Providers**:

   - Cloud providers like **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud** offer **public IPs** on a rental basis as part of their services.
   - These IPs are used to make your application or database available to users from anywhere in the world.

3. **Connecting to a Domain**:

   - A **domain name** can be linked to the public IP address of your app through **DNS (Domain Name System)**.
   - This makes it easier for users to access your app using a memorable domain name instead of an IP address (e.g., `www.example.com` instead of `192.168.x.x`).

4. **Why Cloud Databases Specifically?**:

   - **Reliability**: Cloud databases are maintained by providers to ensure high uptime and minimal data loss.
   - **Scalability**: As your app grows, cloud databases allow you to scale storage and performance effortlessly.
   - **Accessibility**: These databases are hosted on the internet, making them accessible from anywhere, unlike local databases tied to your personal machine or local network.

5. **Summary**:
   - Deploying on the cloud ensures your app has a **public IP** for global accessibility.
   - Cloud databases support this deployment by being accessible from any location while providing reliability, scalability, and ease of management.

### EC2 servers

- VMs on AWS are called EC2 Servers
- EC2 stands for Elastic compute Version 2.
- Elastic - Can increase/decrease the size of the machine
- Compute - It is a machine
- You can spin up a new EC2 instance from the aws dashboard

  ![img](./one.webp)

### Steps to create an EC2 server

1. Click on Launch a new instance

   ![img](./two.webp)

2. Give a name

   ![img](./three.webp)

3. Select an OS

   ![img](./four.webp)

4. Select an size

   ![img](./five.webp)

5. Create a new pair from which we can connect to that server from our local machine through the ip address

   ![img](./six.webp)

6. Select size

   ![img](./eight.webp)

7. select that from where request will be comming http/https

   ![img](./nine.webp)

### SSH into server

1. ssh into machine

```
ssh -i kirat-class.pem ubuntu@ec2-65-0-180-32.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

2. Exception case ( Give ssh key permissions )

   `IF error comes for some skeyecurity purpose of that file we get from aws key pair then run this command then run again that above code ^^`

```
chmod 700 kirat-class.pem
```

3. Git clone

```
git clone https://github.com/hkirat/sum-server
```

`If your aws machine shows you the following error, your aws machine doesnâ€™t have access to the internet

4. Install Node.js

```
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04
```

5. Install all dependencies

```
cd sum-server
npm install
```

6. Start backend

```
node index.js
```

### Try hitting the server

- You have a ip/DNS that you can hit to access your ec2 server
  ![img](./eleven.webp)

- Try visiting your domain

```
your_domain:3000
```

`Notice you cant visit the website`

### process to solve that

- Security group
  ![](./twelvw.webp)

- You can either open port 8080, or process on port 80
  ![](./thirteen.webp)

  ![](./forteen.webp)

```
http://your_domain:8080
```

### What is Nginx?

**Nginx** (pronounced "engine-x") is a powerful web server software that can act as:

![](./1.webp)

1. **Reverse Proxy**:

   - Sits between client requests and your application server
   - Can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers (load balancing)
   - Handles SSL/TLS termination for HTTPS connections

2. **Web Server**:

   - Serves static files directly (images, CSS, JavaScript)
   - More efficient than having your Node.js application handle static content
   - Can compress responses to reduce bandwidth

3. **Key Benefits**:

   - **Performance**: Highly efficient at handling concurrent connections
   - **Security**: Adds an extra layer of security by not exposing your application server directly
   - **Port Management**: Can route traffic from standard ports (80/443) to your application ports (3000, 8080, etc.)

4. **Common Usage with Node.js**:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

5. **Why Use Nginx?**:

   - Industry standard for production deployments
   - Better performance than exposing Node.js directly
   - Handles multiple applications on different ports
   - Manages SSL certificates and HTTPS traffic efficiently

6. **Installing nginx**

```nginx
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

- This should start a nginx server on port 80
- Try visiting the website

![](./2.webp)

7. **Create a reverse Proxy**

```nginx
sudo rm sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
events {
    # Event directives...
}

http {
	server {
    listen 80;
    server_name be1.100xdevs.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
	}
}

sudo nginx -s reload
```

8. **Start the Backend server**

```nginx
node index.js
```

- Visit the website
- https://be1.100xdevs.com/
