- Cloudflare's Wrangler CLI is a command-line tool used to manage and deploy Cloudflare Workers, which are serverless functions running on Cloudflare's edge network. It simplifies development, testing, and publishing of these Workers and their related projects.

## Key Features of Wrangler CLI:

- Deployment: You can deploy your Cloudflare Workers to production or preview environments using a single command (wrangler publish).
- Development Mode: Wrangler allows for local development with wrangler dev, simulating Workers before deployment.
- Environment Configuration: It supports multiple environments like production, staging, etc.
- KV Storage Management: With Wrangler, you can manage Workers KV (Key-Value) storage, which is used for persistent storage in Workers.
- Secrets Management: You can securely store and manage environment variables like API keys (wrangler secret).

## Common Commands:

- wrangler init: Initialize a new Cloudflare Workers project.
- wrangler dev: Run your project locally for development.
- wrangler publish: Deploy your Workers to Cloudflare.
- wrangler kv: Manage Workers KV storage.
